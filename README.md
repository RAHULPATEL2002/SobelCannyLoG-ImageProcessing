## Finding Edges in Images

## AIM
The objective of this MATLAB script is to find the edges in a color image by converting it to grayscale and applying the following edge detection operators:
1. Sobel Operator
2. Canny Operator
3. Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) Operator

---

## Features
This MATLAB script performs the following tasks:
- Converts a color image to grayscale.
- Detects edges using Sobel, Canny, and LoG operators.
- Provides visual comparison of results from the three edge detection methods.
- Allows users to upload an image interactively for processing.

## How to Use
1. Clone or download this repository to your local system.
2. Ensure MATLAB (R2020b or later) and the Image Processing Toolbox are installed.
3. Run the script `edge_detection_lab08.m` in MATLAB.
4. When prompted, select an image file to process (supported formats: `.jpg`, `.png`, `.bmp`).
5. The script will display the original grayscale image and the edge detection results for Sobel, Canny, and LoG operators.

---

## Prerequisites
- MATLAB R2020b or later.
- Image Processing Toolbox.

---

## Instructions
1. Save the file as `edge_detection_lab08.m`.
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the directory containing the script.
3. Run the script in MATLAB by typing `edge_detection_lab08` in the command window.
4. A file dialog will prompt you to upload an image file for processing.
5. Once the image is selected, the script will:
   - Convert the image to grayscale.
   - Apply Sobel, Canny, and LoG edge detection.
   - Display the original grayscale image and the edge detection results.
